# Facebook Conversion API Implementation Updates

## Issues Fixed

1. **TypeScript Type Errors**

   -  Fixed undefined type errors for config variables by providing empty string defaults
   -  Replaced `any` types with more specific type definitions
   -  Fixed import syntax using ES6 modules instead of CommonJS `require`
   -  Added proper typing for Facebook SDK objects

2. **Null/Undefined Handling**

   -  Added proper null/undefined checks for IP addresses and user agent strings
   -  Fixed event data handling with conditional checks
   -  Added proper fallbacks for missing values

3. **Code Structure**

   -  Removed duplicated code in the Facebook Conversion API helper class
   -  Fixed method types and return values

4. **Error Handling**
   -  Enhanced error handling in the API request process

## How to Test

A new test file `test-fb-conversion.ts` has been created that can be used to verify the Facebook Conversion API implementation is working properly:

```bash
# Compile the TypeScript
npx tsc src/test-fb-conversion.ts --outDir dist

# Run the test server
node dist/test-fb-conversion.js
```

Then access `http://localhost:3001/test-fb-conversion` in your browser or with a tool like Postman to test the implementation.

## Next Steps

1. **Set Valid Credentials**: Make sure to set valid Facebook Conversion API credentials in your `.env` file:

   ```
   FACEBOOK_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_access_token
   FACEBOOK_PIXEL_ID=your_pixel_id
   ```

2. **Test Real Events**: Test the implementation with real events in your application flow.

3. **Monitor Events**: Use Facebook Events Manager to monitor the events and ensure they are being properly received and processed.

4. **Expand Event Coverage**: Consider additional events that might be valuable for tracking user behavior.

## Important Notes

-  The implementation now uses TypeScript's strict typing to prevent runtime errors
-  All controller methods have proper error handling to prevent tracking issues from affecting the user experience
-  The code is more maintainable with proper type definitions
